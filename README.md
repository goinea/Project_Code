# Project_Code
Here is my project code in the form of jupyter notebooks as well as my data. Feel free to try it out in python based editors. The pdfs listed before the .py code are how the code looks in the Juypter notebook but the code given has been used in vscode, spyder, and jupyter notebook. The datafile attached is in csv format and once downloaded should be callable by changing the path from where it is uploaded from on your personal computer.
